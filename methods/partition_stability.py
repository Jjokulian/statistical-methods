"""Do the same baskets emerge from independent halves of the feature space?

Every earlier test on this data compares a partition against a null, which is still
conditioned on the features chosen: it answers "given these measurements, is this
grouping better than chance". It cannot answer whether the grouping is a property of
the places or an artifact of what happened to be measured.

Stability answers that, and needs no null and no assumed partition:

    Cluster the stations using a random subset of the variables.
    Cluster them again using a DISJOINT random subset.
    Ask how much the two agree.

A basket that appears only when oxygen is in the subset is an oxygen artifact. A
basket that appears whichever variables are drawn is a property of the stations. And
if agreement RISES as the subsets grow, the derivations are converging on something;
if it stays flat and low, there is nothing to converge on.

Agreement is the adjusted Rand index: the proportion of station pairs the two
partitions agree about (together, or apart), corrected for the agreement two random
partitions of the same shape would reach by chance. 0 is chance, 1 is identity.

The official partition is scored on the same axis - its ARI against each derived
partition - so it is one candidate among the derivations rather than the thing being
graded.

**Deliberately coarse.** Earlier runs matched the official granularity, about four
stations per group, where a random partition scored 0.917 and the statistic had no
room left. Here the target is a dozen groups over a few hundred stations, which is
where a comparison can still discriminate.

    The point of doing this at all: a basket used as a prior for one of its members
    supplies a mean by pooling, and supplies a CONCENTRATION by nothing whatsoever.
    Beta(a, b) is pseudo-counts and a + b is what the prior is worth in observations,
    so an untested boundary is the standard route to a confident prior nobody earned.

    Two separate numbers come out and they are not interchangeable:

      m       mean agreement. How much of the boundary reproduces when the feature
              space it was derived from is swapped for a disjoint one. This is the
              corrective: a group of n members is worth about m*n pseudo-observations
              rather than n. Laplace's +1/+2 in structure, estimated instead of
              assumed.

      kappa   a + b of the fitted Beta. This is how well m itself is pinned down
              ACROSS DRAWS - the reproducibility of the stability estimate, not the
              pooling licence. Conflating it with the licence would be the same
              category error this file exists to test for.

    ARI runs below zero (two partitions can agree less than chance), and a Beta does
    not, so draws are clipped at 0. That is a floor, not a rescaling: a negative ARI
    and a zero ARI both mean the boundary carries nothing, and the difference between
    them is not information about how much.
