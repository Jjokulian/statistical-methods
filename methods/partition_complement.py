"""Does a basket built on k dimensions agree with the basket built on all the rest?

The earlier run compared a k-subset against a DISJOINT EQUAL-SIZED subset, and
averaged. Two things are wrong with that.

  The comparison. An arbitrary other k-subset may itself produce a garbage basketing,
  so agreeing with it establishes nothing. The complement is the strongest alternative
  available: every dimension not used to build the basket, pooled. ARI(P_F, P_~F) asks
  whether what F says about these stations is what everything else says.

  The averaging. Reporting a mean over all pairs lets bad baskets vote. If random
  k-combinations mostly do not produce good baskets, the mean measures what bad
  baskets have in common - a popularity contest among them - and it will look like
  agreement. The question "are random 2-combinations good basket creation?" is
  answered by the DISTRIBUTION of complement agreement, not by its centre, so the
  distribution is what is reported: quartiles, extremes, how many subsets clear the
  permuted floor, and which dimensions the good ones contain.

AND IT IS THE PART THAT SCALES. Each test costs exactly two clusterings - the subset
and its complement - so the cost is linear in the number of draws and INDEPENDENT of
how large the combinatorial space is. Nine variables happen to admit exhaustive
enumeration (2^9 - 2 = 510 subsets); fifty do not, and never will. Anything that
weighs subsets against each other needs the whole space to mean anything and is
therefore 2^V; the complement comparison needs one well-defined alternative per draw
and is therefore O(draws). Sampling loses nothing here: with --draws the same
distribution is estimated from a sample, and the distribution is the answer.
